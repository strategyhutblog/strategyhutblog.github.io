Leading Africa business development company, ATIGS Group is proud to announce a partnership with Strategy Hut to host the 2020 Africa Trade and Investment Global Summit (ATIGS) on October 28 & 29, 2020 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

ATIGS is a unique business platform to foster relationships and engage efficiently with key influencers and investors from every corner of the world. During a period of two days, Vice presidents, Ministers, Governors, Business Executives, top CEOs, international investors and companies seeking to expand in African markets are gathered in one single place to discuss concrete investment projects and establish strategic partnerships through thematic workshops, presentations, and networking sessions.

In 2018, ATIGS Group hosted the premier ATIGS in the United States. With more than 2,300 delegates from 92 countries, ATIGS USA 2018 was a great success for both the hosting country, sponsors and the participants. High-potential industries and companies were presented to a select audience which led to direct engagement, deal-making, co-investments and the establishment of business partnerships. Over one (1) billion worth of deals were signed at ATIGS USA 2018.

The next edition, ATIGS Dubai 2020 will be a more exclusive high-level gathering for government officials, high-profile African business leaders, project developers, and international investors from Africa, UAE, Asia, Europe, and America. www.atigs2020.com

“For more than 150 years World Expo’s have brought together inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs who have changed the world and advanced societies through cross-border collaboration. For much of that history, African inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs have struggled to gain the access to networks and markets required to scale their contributions and radically transform societies. ATIGS provides a unique opportunity for them to make new connections, secure new investments and ultimately grow and expand through strategic partnerships,” said Comfort Avunze Sakoma, Founder and CEO of Strategy Hut, Ltd.

Under this partnership, Strategy Hut joins efforts with ATIGS Group in the capacity of a Supporting Partner for ATIGS Dubai 2020, and now entitled to participate in the business and affairs of ATIGS Dubai 2020. Strategy Hut will promote participation from Nigerian public and private sector entities in ATIGS Dubai 2020 to further drive FDI and international trade to the country.

“Hosting ATIGS is a huge contribution to the development of Africa, and we are excited to partner with Strategy Hut to advance the mission and agenda of ATIGS Dubai 2020.” said, Bako Ambianda, Chairman and CEO of ATIGS Group, Inc.

ATIGS Dubai 2020 is presented by ATIGS Group, Inc, and organized by Global Attain Advancement, LLC, known as GAA Exhibitions & Conferences, and supported by partners & sponsors. www.gaaexhibitions.com
